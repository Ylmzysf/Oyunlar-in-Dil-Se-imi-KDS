# Language Decision for Games DSS
A sample decision support system that I developed for my KDS course.
The project is a node.js project that requires a node modules file to work, the paths in the routes file have the same name as the relevant html pages or their English equivalents. 
The aim of the project is to help an indie game company decide in which languages ​​its games should be published.
